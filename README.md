###Description of project
This small project looks at using functions and TDD.

We're also implementing Agile and Scrum principles.

Topics covered include:
-functions
-TDD
-Documentation
-Installation
-Agile
-Scrum


### Main functions
Functions are like people at work they are like poeple at work. They have one job!
This makes it easier to test


### How do they work?
1)We need to define them
2)then call them
3)They run the block that is indented.

Other functionality:
- They can take in arguments to be dynamic of morph output

If a variable is like a box, you name it and lace things inside. The box 
does NOT interact with your stuff. For exampke, if you name a box 'books'
and place some potatoes insode , you do not get french fries,

A **function** is like a machine.It can interact with things you put inside.It can take inputs and follow a set of 
instructions(AKA the block of code)

#Why functions?
Because it keeps our code DRY:
-Dont
-Reapeat
-Yourself

#Best practices of function
-naming convention in python is like a variable, lower_case_underscore()
-IT DOES ONE! JOB! -- 
-DON'T PRINT IN FUNCTIONS
-Separate of concerns principle (single point of failure in code)
    -helps remove single point of failure in code
    - makes code more maintainable

## Basis of test
A test has known or controlled input and expected output
All it is, is an assertion.

unit test is the testing o one single function.

You give it a know input and you assert for expected out put

Run it, GET true or False.
